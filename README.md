# Java OOP Projects Collection

A repository dedicated to showcasing my progress and hands-on experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and other using Java.

This collection includes various console applications and simulations designed to demonstrate:

* **Core OOP Principles:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
* **Design Patterns:** Implementation of basic design patterns (Factory, Singleton, etc.) in future projects.
* **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Practical implementation within real-world simulation contexts.
